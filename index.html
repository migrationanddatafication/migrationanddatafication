                            <p>Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and related fields of research are advocating for comprehensive investigations into the role of data and data-driven technologies 
                                to ensure responsible and appropriate usage within the context of migration, particularly for refugees and asylum seekers - a domain, set to be fundamentally reformed by 
                                data-driven technologies. The growing production of new types of data about refugees and asylum seekers presents authorities with novel opportunities to incorporate such 
                                data in their decision-making processes. Similarly, the ways through which refugees and asylum seekers are seeking information about healthcare, education, housing, peer support 
                                and other services is increasingly being done in online and digital spaces. As such, this workshop aims to center the experience of refugee and asylum seeking experiences across 
                                migration related information systems in order to unpack the ways through which digitalization and datafication impacts/transforms their daily lives and vice versa.</p>

                            <p>We invite anyone interested in participating to submit a two to four-page position paper (or equivalent material such as e.g. zines) that addresses the workshop themes (see below). 
                                We encourage you to discuss your interest in the themes, welcoming reports of (preliminary) empirical results, theoretically oriented pieces, as well as methodological reflections. 
                                We also welcome submissions reflecting on questions related to datafication, digitization, and migration that we have not listed in our themes. Submissions will
                                be reviewed by the organisers and accepted based on the relevance and development of their chosen topic, as well as
                                participants’ potential to contribute to the workshop.<br />

                                <li><b>Firaz Peer</b> is an Assistant Professor of Information Communication Technology in University of Kentucky's School of Information Science. As part of his research, he studies issues of accountability, justice, care, and equity that manifest when building, using, and maintaining algorithmic and data infrastructures with marginalized communities. He does this by combining participatory and design based research methods with scholarship from Human Computer Interaction and Science & Technology Studies.</li>
                                <li><b>Trine Rask Nielsen</b> is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen and part of the Confronting Data Co-lab. Her PhD research is grounded in the research fields Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Critical Data Studies. She is interested in understanding the technology-supported (collaborative) work practices and the workflows that support the asylum procedure. She investigates the social context surrounding how data about displaced individuals applying for asylum are produced, stored, and shared by and across different asylum actors, and used to inform asylum decisions.</li>
                                <li><b>Kristin Kaltenhäuser</b> is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen and part of the Confronting Data Co-lab. Her interdisciplinary research spans the fields of data science, CSCW and critical data studies and data feminism. Taking a participatory approach, her research evolves around grounded sense-making of data in asylum decision-making in the Nordic countries, focusing especially on marginalized groups and outliers in the data.</li>
                                <li><b>Vasilis Vlachokyriakos</b> is a Reader (Associate Professor) of Human-Computer Interaction and Digital Civics at Open Lab, Newcastle University, School of Computing and co-founder of Open Lab Athens. Vasilis' work centres on designing technologies for civic participation through participatory and action-led research. The work aims at the development of systems for collaborative service provision. Vasilis is currently an investigator on the EPSRC Centre for Digital Citizens and on the EPSRC Agency projects. </li>
                                <li><b>Naja Holten Møller</b> is an Associate Professor in the Software, Data, People & Society section, Department of Computer Science, at University of Copenhagen -- and the founder of the Confronting Data Co-Lab (www.confrontingdata.dk). She holds a PhD in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work from the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Møller is currently a co-investigator in the "Public Administration and Computational Transparency in Algorithms (PACTA)" research project as well as the "Data for Asylum Legal Landscaping (DATA4ALL)" research project.</li>
                                <li><b>Reem Talhouk</b> is an Assistant Professor in Design and Global Development at the School of Design, Northumbria University. She is also the co-director of the Design Feminisms Research Group and the Community Action & Innovation Lead of the Global Development Futures hub. Here research has centred around Design, Technology and Migration and draws on feminist, participatory and decolonial understandings.</li>
